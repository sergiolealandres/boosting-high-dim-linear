# Boosting for High-Dimensional Linear Models

This project investigates the theoretical and practical aspects of L2 Boosting, a machine learning technique designed for regression and classification in high-dimensional settings. The main focus is on:

- Explaining the L2 Boosting algorithm
- Using AIC and BIC to determine optimal stopping iterations
- Testing the algorithm on both simulated and real-world high-dimensional datasets
- Applying dimensionality reduction methods (PCA and autoencoders)
- Comparing L2 Boosting with other models such as Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, and XGBoost

The results highlight L2 Boosting's effectiveness in sparse data environments, particularly for feature selection and classification tasks.
